## Workflow Logic

### 1. Gmail Trigger
- Monitors your Gmail Primary inbox for new messages
- Uses Gmail's category filter (`category:primary`)
- Only processes unread messages in the INBOX
- Polls at regular intervals (default: every minute)

### 2. Extract Email Details
- Extracts key information from the email:
  - Sender name/address
  - Email subject
  - Message snippet (preview)
  - Received time
  - Direct link to the email

### 3. Send Telegram Notification
- Formats a clean, readable message
- Includes all key email details
- Uses Markdown formatting for better readability
- Provides a direct link to open the email
- Disables web page previews to keep notifications clean

## Customization Options

### Change Email Filtering
In the **Monitor Gmail Primary Inbox** node, modify the `q` parameter:
- `category:primary` - Current setting for Primary inbox
- `category:social` - For social media notifications
- `category:promotions` - For promotional emails
- `category:updates` - For updates and notifications
- `category:forums` - For forum posts and mailing lists

You can also combine filters:
- `category:primary is:important` - Important Primary emails
- `category:primary from:example.com` - Primary emails from specific domain

### Customize Notification Format
In the **Send Telegram Notification** node, modify the `text` parameter to change the message format. The current format is:

```
ðŸ”” *New Email Alert*

*From:* {{ $json.from }}
*Subject:* {{ $json.subject }}
*Received:* {{ $json.receivedTime }}

*Preview:*
{{ $json.snippet }}

[Open Email]({{ $json.emailLink }})
```

### Add More Information
To include additional email details, modify the **Extract Email Details** node:

```json
{
  "name": "hasAttachments",
  "value": "={{ $json.payload?.headers?.find(h => h.name === 'X-Attachment-Id') ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}"
}
```

Then update the Telegram message to include this information:
```
*Attachments:* {{ $json.hasAttachments }}
```
